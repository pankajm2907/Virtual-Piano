# Virtual-Piano
A virtual piano using a new port for an old library
This virtual piano uses an old library and also teaches you how to use an old library in new IDEs
To port the graphic.h we have to download the library first and then open the code of the library as a whole on your IDE which will then update the library
Now to code open a new cpp file in the prject and write the code.
PS: The code is still updating as I am finding new libraries to replace the beep with legit musical notes.
